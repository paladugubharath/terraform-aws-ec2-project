# 🚀 AWS Infrastructure Automation using Terraform with CI/CD

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provisions AWS infrastructure using Terraform (Infrastructure as Code) and automates deployment using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

The infrastructure includes networking components and an EC2 instance that automatically installs and runs Nginx using a user_data script.

This project demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to provision AWS resources and automate deployment using GitHub Actions.

An EC2 instance is created inside a custom VPC and automatically installs and runs Nginx using a user_data script.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The following AWS resources are created:

- VPC
- Public Subnet
- Internet Gateway
- Route Table
- Security Group
- EC2 Instance (Amazon Linux)
- Nginx Web Server (Installed via user_data)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

- AMI ID is passed using Terraform variables (not hardcoded)
- Sensitive files are excluded using .gitignore
- AWS credentials are stored securely in GitHub Secrets
- terraform.tfstate is not pushed to GitHub

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Initialize Terraform

terraform init

### Step 2: Validate Configuration

terraform validate

### Step 3: Plan Infrastructure

terraform plan

### Step 4: Apply Infrastructure

terraform apply

### Step 5: Destroy Infrastructure (After Testing)

terraform destroy

---

## 📤 CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate:

- terraform init
- terraform plan
- terraform apply

Pipeline runs automatically on push to main branch.
